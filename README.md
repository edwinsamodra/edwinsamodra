### Hi, I'm Edwin! 👋

I am a Software Engineer focusing on **Platform Engineering**, **Infrastructure Automation**, and tools that improve **Developer Experience (DevEx)**. Most of my work revolves around building internal-facing systems that help Engineering teams move faster.

- Focus: I develop Ops-centric software and Internal Developer Platform (IDP), merging the discipline of Software Engineering with the needs of Infrastructure.
- Learning: I am deeply invested in the Linux ecosystem and DevOps toolchains, constantly experimenting with concepts in my personal homelab.
- Experience: With 4+ years of **coding experience**, I am a disciplined autodidact who loves building projects from scratch.


### Technology Stack

**Languages:** `JS/TS`

**Infra & Automation:** `Linux` · `Docker` · `Ansible` · `Terraform` · `Proxmox` · `Cloud (AWS / GCP)`
